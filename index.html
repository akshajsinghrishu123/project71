    <p class="text-muted">A church is a public place of worship, usually for people of the Christian religion. Some Christian denominations, or groups, also have buildings called cathedrals. A cathedral serves as the central, or main, church for a geographical area.

      The layout and design of churches can vary greatly. Still, many churches share some common features.
      
      Most churches include an altar, or a raised platform. The people who perform the religious services are called the clergy. They stand at the altar during the services.
      
      All churches have a seating area for the congregation, or people attending services in the church. Usually people sit in long wooden benches called pews. Some churches have separate seating areas for the choir, or people who sing at church.
      
      Many churches have a bell tower containing one or more bells. The bells ring before and after services, to celebrate religious holidays, and sometimes to mark the time of day. Many churches also have stained glass windows. These colorful windows often show stories from the Bible.
      
      Protestant churches tend to be more simple in their design than Roman Catholic churches and cathedrals. Protestant churches usually have fewer religious statues and other decorations as well.</p>

     My school has a big library, situated near the auditorium.
    
     Our class visits the library once a week.
    
     Various storybooks, novels, comics, etc are present in our library.
    
     I eagerly wait for the library period because I love reading storybooks.
    
     My school library has a large table to sit and read surrounded by bookshelves.
    
     When we get any assignments, we use books from our library.
    
     I also spend my free periods in school library.
    
     We can also issue books from the library for a few days.
    
     In my school library, we all are requested to maintain pin-drop silence.></p>

  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School auditorium</kbd></h4>
  <hr>
  <h5 class="text-muted text-capitalize"> Was build in 1982</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">I read in a very big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as the auditorium. It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.

    It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.
    
    There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.
    
    The front door is the widest. The four other doors two in the either wall are comparatively less wide. Besides, there are two small doors behind the dais which open into small green houses.
    
    
    At the time of any function, sofas and chairs are installed on the stage, that is, dais. Chairs and benches are then also installed in the entire hall for students. Only participants, senior teachers and VIPs sit on the sofas and chairs on the dais.
    
    At the time of school functions such as annual prize distribution, variety show, fancy dress show, speech-making, debates, seminars, workshops, declamation contests, quiz contests, etc. some prominent citizens are also invited.
    
    Our school hall being quite spacious long is known to be a suitable place for holding such functions as inter-school contests, blood donation camps, various disease awareness campaigns such as pulse polio, tuberculosis control, leprosy control, etc. It is also sometimes used by the district administration for conferences, etc.

  <p>On 15th October 2021, Delhi Public School, Bokaro, organised a science exhibition in its school auditorium. A number of students from various classes participated in the exhibition. The science exhibition was held in honour of Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalamâ€™s birthday. The chief guest for this exhibition was Mr Shiv Murty, one of the renowned scientists. The exhibition started at 12:00 p.m. and was open to all the parents and students of the school. The Principal of the school gave a commencement speech and announced that the best three exhibits would be selected by the National Science Foundation, India to display in their labs. As the exhibition started, various students presented their projects. Models of solar power energy, space satellites, hydroelectric generators, AC and DC motors, automatic transformers, and robots were built by the students. Mr. Murthy, along with the Principal, went around looking at the different models designed by the students and assessed the descriptions given by the students. The parents, too, looked at the various models put up by the students. Apart from models, the students also organised visual presentations to help everyone understand the concepts of their working models. Mr. Murty gave a speech on the importance of the contributions of the young generations to the field of science and technology. At the end of the exhibition, upon careful inspection of the different models and projects, Mr. Murty selected three projects from Class 5, Class 8 and Class 10, respectively. Everyone who participated in the exhibition were given certificates and mementoes for their excellent efforts. The exhibition ended with the Principal delivering a speech extending her gratitude to Mr. Murty and congratulating all the students who participated in the exhibition.</p>

     to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online
      menus with photographs of th meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both 
      students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the
       canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their
        previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering onlin by ticking a box and 
        paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less 
        complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

<p>class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Implemented Online Attendance Management
   System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a 
   student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps
    schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and 
    this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential
     that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish
      connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's 
      Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be 
      displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the 
      security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are 
      caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will 
      improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents 
      are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner 
      and at reduced costs.</p>
